// Reading a input character 
// & then printing it again in the output.
main() {
    int c;

    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        putChar(c);
    }
}

In the earlier version of c, function would have been written like this:

int power(base, n) // parameters are named between the parentheses
int base, n; // and their types are declared before opening left brace
{

}

When a name of an array is passed to a function, the value passed to the function is the location 
or address of the beginning of the array - there is no copying of elements. 

Character Arrays:
The most common type of array in C is the array of characters. 


while (there's another line) 
    if (it's longer than the previous longest)
        save it
        save its length
print the longest line



max_length = 5
char str[max_length];

for (int i = 0; i < max_length - 1; i++) {
   str[i] = getchar();
}

It should be fine as you're breaking on new-line as well.
